Explainer
=========

The library provides insights into the algorithm's behavior by identifying the features that impact the imputation results. It trains a regression model to predict imputation results across various methods and uses SHapley Additive exPlanations (`SHAP <https://shap.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_) to reveal how different time series features influence the model’s predictions.

Let's illustrate the explainer using the CDRec algorithm and MCAR missingness pattern:

.. code-block:: python

    from imputegap.recovery.manager import TimeSeries
    from imputegap.recovery.explainer import Explainer
    from imputegap.tools import utils

    # initialize the time series and explainer object
    ts = TimeSeries()
    exp = Explainer()

    # load and normalize the dataset
    ts.load_series(utils.search_path("eeg-alcohol"))
    ts.normalize(normalizer="z_score")

    # configure the explanation
    exp.shap_explainer(input_data=ts.data, extractor="pycatch", pattern="mcar", file_name=ts.name, algorithm="CDRec")

    # print the impact of each feature
    exp.print(exp.shap_values, exp.shap_details)


All feature extractors developed in ImputeGAP are available in the ``ts.extractors`` module, which can be listed as follows:

.. code-block:: python

    from imputegap.recovery.manager import TimeSeries
    ts = TimeSeries()
    print(f"ImputeGAP features extractors : {ts.extractors}")

Setup

.. note::

    -   M : number of time series
    -   N : length of time series
    -   R : user-defined rate of missing values (%); default = 0.2
    -   W : user-defined offset window in the beginning of the series (%); default = 0.1
    -   S : user-defined rate of contaminated series (%); default = 0.2

.. _scenario_mono_block:

MONO-BLOCK
----------
One missing block per series


**Aligned**

The missing blocks are aligned.

.. note::

    -   ``R ∈ [1%, (100-W)%]``
    -   The size of a single missing block varies between 1% and (100 - ``W``)% of ``N``.
    -   The starting position is the same and begins at ``W`` and progresses until the size of the missing block is reached, affecting the first series from the top up to ``S%`` of the dataset.

**Disjoint**

The missing blocks are disjoint.

.. note::

    -   ``R ∈ [1%, (100-W)%]``
    -   The size of a single missing block varies between 1% and (100 - ``W``)% of ``N``.
    -   The starting position of the first missing block begins at ``W``.
    -   Each subsequent missing block starts immediately after the previous one ends, continuing this pattern until the limit of the dataset or ``N`` is reached.

**Overlap**:

The missing blocks are overlapping.

.. note::

    -   ``R ∈ [1%, (100-W)%]``
    -   The size of a single missing block varies between 1% and (100 - ``W``)% of ``N``.
    -   The starting position of the first missing block begins at ``W``.
    -   Each subsequent missing block starts after the previous one ends, but with a shift back of ``X%``, creating an overlap.
    -   This pattern continues until the limit or ``N`` is reached.

**Scattered**

The missing blocks are scattered.

.. note::

    -   ``R ∈ [1%, (100-W)%]``
    -   The size of a single missing block varies between 1% and (100 - ``W``)% of ``N``.
    -   The starting position is randomly shifted by adding a random value to ``W``, then progresses until the size of the missing block is reached, affecting the first series from the top up to ``S%`` of the dataset.

.. _scenario_multi_block:

MULTI-BLOCK
-----------

Multiple missing blocks per series


**MCAR**

The blocks are missing completely at random

.. note::

    -   ``R ∈ [1%, (100-W)%]``
    -   Data blocks of the same size are removed from arbitrary series at a random position between ``W`` and ``N``, until the total number of missing values per series is reached.

**Block Distribution**

The missing blocks follow a distribution.

.. note::

    -   ``R ∈ [1%, (100-W)%]``
    -   Data is removed following a distribution given by the user for every values of the series, affecting the first series from the top up to ``S%`` of the dataset.

To configure the distribution pattern, please refer to this `tutorial <tutorials_distribution.html>`_.
